<h2>Product Reviews</h2>

<h3 class="review">Out of Sight!!!</h3>
<p>
  Out of mind. My mom bought this for me, and I hate it. Left it at
   her place, and I keep telling her I’m going to come back and get it.
  And well, I guess I do appreciate the thought? But honestly,
  it’s the wrong kind of freaky. Not really cool, just kind of weird.
  And I swear that thing is watching me. Think twice, maybe ask first,
  if you’re going to get this for someone. It’s a pretty niche audience.
  </p>
<h3 class="review">An Eye Catching Find</h3>
<p>
  Got this purse for my daughter, and she absolutely loves it!
  I think it’s a bit weird, but then she’s a bit weird, that’s why
  I bought it. It is a little bit freaky, how it seems to follow you.
  Or not follow you? Weird either way. But she loves it, and that’s what
   matters. Absolutely purchase as a gift for your spookiest loved ones.
    </p>
<h3 class="review">What once was seen...</h3>

<p>
        The eye is shut. It must be shut. It will always be shut.
        But I saw it open, and now it always watches me.
        I asked my wife, but she said it was shut.
         And it is, when she looks at it.
         But when I look, when I look…it’s shut. It must be.
         Please purchase this product. 10/10, would recommend.
