  <h1>A War on Snow</h1>

  <p>
    Snow is always a problem in Wisconsin, and it's been particularly bad these past few weeks.
    Thus a plan of action is needed:

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Snow Blower
        </li>
        <li>
          The Shovel
          </li>
          <li>
            The Podcast
            </li>
            <li>
              The Cocoa
              </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <h2>The Snow Blower</h2>
  <p>
    The snow blower is <s>an advantage</s> a <i>necessity</i> when the driveway wraps around the entire house.
    It's very old style,  from the 1930s, going to the garage in the back, and it makes
    the whole event slightly less of an epic struggle. Even old and with the blade battered,
     it's better than shoveling by hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      The state of the snow blower does mean it's still very time consuming. Clearing the driveway
      generally takes almost two hours. The snow blower does not blow far enough, which means
      that multiple passes are needed. And it alone is not enough to clear the snow.
      </p>
  <h2>The Shovel</h2>
  <p>
    The shovel is an essential part of the process, slow and old fashioned as it is.
    The snow blower leaves remnants which can only be dealt with by hand. And the patio itself
    is too much work to use the snow blower, so shoveling it is! And at least it's a break from the noise,
    and hopefully a bit of exercise too.
    </p>

    <h2>The Podcast</h2>
    <p>
      The one consolation prize for the war on snow is that it does give me a chance to catch up on podcasts.
      Entertainment helps pass the time, and I have enough to listen to I tend to get behind. And with the
      necessity of the task, it's a bit of guilt free entertainment!
      </p>
      <h2>The Cocoa</h2>
      <p>
        When it's all said and done, the reward is a steaming cup of hot cocoa. And the special
        prize there is that recently my mom has taken to making her own marshmallows. So not only is there
        cocoa, but I get to put some cute <b>Mitten Marshallows</b><sup>TM</sup> on top. The perfect reward for the job!
